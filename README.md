# 🎨 Color Flipper

Welcome to the **Color Flipper** project! 
This is a fun little web app that lets you change the background color of your page with just a click. It comes with two modes: **Simple** and **Hex**. Feel free to explore and enjoy flipping colors!

## 🌟 Demo

You can see it in action (https://adityagupta84.github.io/Color-flipper/)

## 📋 What's Inside

This project is super simple and includes the following:

- `index.html`: The page for the Simple mode.
- `hex.html`: The page for the Hex mode.
- `style.css`: A bit of styling to make things look nice.
- `main.js` and `hex.js`: The magic (JavaScript) that makes the colors flip!

## ✨ Features

- **Simple Mode**: Switches the background color using a set list of colors.
- **Hex Mode**: Generates a random hex color every time you click the button.

## 🔍 How It Works

When you click the "click me" button, the background color changes:

In Simple mode, it cycles through a few predefined colors.
In Hex mode, it generates a random hex code, giving you endless color options!

## ❤️ Why I Made This

Sometimes, the simplest projects can be the most fun. I built this to practice working with JavaScript and DOM manipulation, and I hope it helps others learn too!
